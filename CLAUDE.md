## Design Philosophy

- Nullable fields are valuable like "red tests" - leave data empty until necessary logic is built
- Don't hesitate to use null values as placeholders
- Null values can remain unset until a specific feature is implemented
- Nullable fields allow for gradual feature development and can be filled or backfilled later

## System Configuration

- Environment variables are typically stored in `.zshrc` file on macOS
